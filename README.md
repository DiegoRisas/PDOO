Programación y Diseño Orientado a Objetos 2023-24 (Irrgarten)

Project of a simple game using Java & Ruby to showcase and understand Object Oriented programming.

The game consists of a Labyrinth (matrix) in which the players move to get to the exit box, avoiding blocks and combating with the monsters they encounter.


As of right now (commit main funtionality) you have to run the main file and walk trough the game with the keys wsad (in each iteration of the game) until one player gets to the exit box.
